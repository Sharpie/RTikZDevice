# tikzDevice

---

## Description

The tikzDevice package provides a graphics device for R that enables direct
output of graphics in a LaTeX-friendly way.  Plotting commands issued by R
functions are transformed into LaTeX code blocks.  These blocks are interpreted
with the help of TikZ-- a graphics library for TeX and friends written by Till
Tantau.

The tikzDevice supports three main modes of output:

  - Figure chunks: placed in .tex files and suitable for inclusion in
    LaTeX documents via the \input{} command.

  - Stand alone figures: Complete LaTeX documents containing figure
    code that can be compiled into stand-alone images.  Pages are
    cropped to the size of the figure using the LaTeX preview package.

  - Console output: TikZ code is returned directly to the R console
    as a character vector for further manipulation.


## Beta Notice

The tikzDevice is currently flagged as a beta work.  The package is
reasonably stable and has been used by the authors to produce graphics
for academic publications for over a year.  The reason for beta status
is that there are several open design issues- two of which are:

  - Providing support for UTF8 text.

  - Supporting TeX variants other than LaTeX.

Resolving these issues may require changes to the tikzDevice that break
backwards compatibility with previous versions.  The beta flag is a reminder
that such changes may occur- although we will strive to avoid them if possible.

The beta flag will be removed upon release of version 1.0. At this time the
tikzDevice will switch to [semantic versioning][1] and changes that
break backwards compatibility will happen rarely and will incur a major release.
