Title: A Device for R Graphics Output in PGF/TikZ Format

Description: The TikZ device enables LaTeX-ready output from R graphics 
        functions. This is done by producing code that can be understood by 
        the TikZ graphics language. All text in a graphic output with the 
        tikz() function will can be typeset by LaTeX and therefore will match 
        whatever fonts are currently used in the document. This also means 
        that LaTeX mathematics can be typeset directly into labels and 
        annotations!  Graphics produced this way can also be annotated with 
        custom TikZ commands.
