Title: A Device for R Graphics Output in PGF/TikZ Format
LazyLoad: yes
Author: Charlie Sharpsteen <chuck@sharpsteen.net> and Cameron Bracken
    <cameron.bracken@gmail.com>
Description: The TikZ device enables LaTeX-ready output from R graphics
    functions. This is done by producing code that can be understood by
    the TikZ graphics language. All text in a graphic output with the
    tikz() function will can be typeset by LaTeX and therefore will
    match whatever fonts are currently used in the document. This also
    means that LaTeX mathematics can be typeset directly into labels
    and annotations!  Graphics produced this way can also be annotated
    with custom TikZ commands.
