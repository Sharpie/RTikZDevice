Description: The TikZ device enables LaTeX-ready output from R graphics
        functions. This is done by producing code that can be understood by
        the TikZ graphics language. All text in a graphic output with the
        tikz() function will can be typeset by LaTeX and therefore will match
        whatever fonts are currently used in the document. This also means
        that LaTeX mathematics can be typeset directly into labels and
        annotations!  Graphics produced this way can also be annotated with
        custom TikZ commands.
