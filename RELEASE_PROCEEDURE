TikZ Device Release Proceedure
==============================

(Or, "how to move commits from GitHub to RForge")

**NOTE**:

I recently moved from tagging releases on the master branch to tagging them on
r-forge because the r-forge branch contains pre-built NAMESPACE and .Rd files.
That way users can download a tag tarball and feed it right to R CMD INSTALL.

Unfortunately this messed up some of the steps below, so this document is no
longer entirely accurate.

Steps:

  * Check out the branch synced with R-Forge:

      git checkout r-forge

  * Bring in master branch as a squashed merge, but do not commit:

      git merge -srecursive -Xtheirs --no-commit master

  * Run `make release` to update the vignette PDFs and the R man pages along
    with the version number in inst/GIT_VERSION.

      make release

  * May be some merge conflicts due to files that are present in the RForge
    branch, but deleated in the master branch, such as the vignette PDFs and
    the R man pages.  Clear these up using git-add:

      git add man
      git add inst/doc

  * Commit all changes. Add a commit note summarizing what happened:

      git commit -a

  * Push to RForge:

      git svn dcommit

  * ???

  * Profit!
